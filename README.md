# Jimmy's Garage

### My first MVC project

I built this project to learn more about REST APIs and how they interact with the front-end.

In it I:

* built a back-end using Node.JS,

* implemented API endpoints using ExpressJS*,

* built the front end using the EJS template engine,

* created a dashboard where the administrators can create, modify or delete
the content,

* used JSON Web Token to authenticate the login and administrative rights,

* used Mongoose schemas to store the MongoDB document information,

* outsourced the created documents to MongoDB Atlas,

* utilized the Cloudinary API for uploading images,

* implemented some front-end functionalities â€“ such as pagination, search
and image preview before uploading,

* created responsive public views for smart phones and responsive admin
views for tablets

---

**Although I created the endpoints with JSON responses initially, I had
to switch to rendering views due to certain limitations on my end.*
